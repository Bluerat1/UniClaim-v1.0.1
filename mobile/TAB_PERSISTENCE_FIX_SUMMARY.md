# Tab Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem Description
After saving profile picture changes in the mobile app, the app was automatically redirecting users back to the first tab (labeled "Home" but actually showing MyTickets) instead of staying on the Profile tab.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `BottomTabs` component's state management:
- The `currentTab` state was initialized as `"MyTickets"` (first tab) every time the component re-rendered
- When the Profile component saved changes and triggered a re-render, the BottomTabs would reset to its initial state
- There was no mechanism to remember which tab was last active

## Solution Implemented
Implemented persistent tab state using AsyncStorage to remember the last selected tab across component re-renders.

### Changes Made to `mobile/components/BottomTabs.tsx`:

1. **Added AsyncStorage import**
   ```typescript
   import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";
   ```

2. **Added initialization state**
   ```typescript
   const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);
   ```

3. **Added tab loading logic**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     const loadSavedTab = async () => {
       try {
         const savedTab = await AsyncStorage.getItem('lastActiveTab');
         if (savedTab && tabs.some(tab => tab.key === savedTab)) {
           setCurrentTab(savedTab);
         }
       } catch (error) {
         console.log('Error loading saved tab:', error);
       } finally {
         setIsInitialized(true);
       }
     };
     
     loadSavedTab();
   }, []);
   ```

4. **Updated tab change handler**
   ```typescript
   const handleTabChange = async (newTab: string) => {
     if (newTab !== currentTab) {
       previousTabRef.current = currentTab;
       setCurrentTab(newTab);
       
       // Save the new tab state to AsyncStorage
       try {
         await AsyncStorage.setItem('lastActiveTab', newTab);
       } catch (error) {
         console.log('Error saving tab state:', error);
       }
     }
   };
   ```

5. **Added loading screen**
   ```typescript
   if (!isInitialized) {
     return (
       <SafeAreaView className="flex-1 bg-white" edges={["top", "left", "right"]}>
         <View className="flex-1 items-center justify-center">
           <Text>Loading...</Text>
         </View>
       </SafeAreaView>
     );
   }
   ```

## How It Works Now

1. **App Start**: Component loads the last active tab from AsyncStorage
2. **Tab Switch**: When user switches tabs, the new tab is saved to AsyncStorage
3. **Profile Save**: When Profile component updates, BottomTabs re-renders but remembers the last active tab
4. **Persistent State**: The Profile tab stays active even after re-renders

## Benefits

- ✅ **Profile tab stays active** after saving profile picture changes
- ✅ **No more automatic redirect** to the first tab
- ✅ **Tab selection persists** across component re-renders
- ✅ **Smooth user experience** without unexpected navigation
- ✅ **Uses existing AsyncStorage package** (already installed)

## Testing

Created and ran `test-tab-persistence.js` to verify:
- Tab state can be saved to AsyncStorage
- Tab state can be loaded from AsyncStorage
- Tab validation works correctly
- Tab switching is persistent
- Storage can be cleared properly

**Result**: All tests passed ✅

## Files Modified

- `mobile/components/BottomTabs.tsx` - Main implementation
- `mobile/test-tab-persistence.js` - Test file (can be deleted after verification)
- `mobile/TAB_PERSISTENCE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## User Experience Impact

**Before**: User saves profile picture → App automatically redirects to first tab → Confusing navigation

**After**: User saves profile picture → App stays on Profile tab → Smooth, expected behavior

The fix ensures users remain on the Profile tab after making changes, providing a much better and more intuitive user experience.
