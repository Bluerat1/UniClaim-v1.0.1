# Duplicate Image Upload Fix

## Problem
Images were being uploaded twice to Cloudinary, causing duplicates in your account.

## Root Cause
React StrictMode was causing form submissions to be triggered twice in development mode, leading to duplicate image uploads.

## Solution Implemented
Added a submission protection flag (`isSubmitting`) to prevent duplicate form submissions.

### What Was Changed

1. **ReportPage.tsx** - Added submission protection
   - Added `isSubmitting` state variable
   - Prevents form submission while upload is in progress
   - Shows loading state on submit button
   - Logs when duplicate submissions are blocked

2. **Cloudinary Services** - Added logging
   - Added console logs to track upload requests
   - Helps debug any future upload issues
   - Shows when files are skipped (already uploaded)

### How It Works

1. When user clicks "Submit report":
   - `isSubmitting` is set to `true`
   - Form becomes disabled
   - Button shows "Submitting..." text

2. If user tries to submit again (or React StrictMode triggers):
   - Function returns early if `isSubmitting` is `true`
   - Prevents duplicate uploads
   - Logs the blocked attempt

3. After upload completes (success or error):
   - `isSubmitting` is set back to `false`
   - Form becomes enabled again
   - Button returns to normal state

## Benefits

✅ **No more duplicate uploads** - Each image uploads only once  
✅ **Better user experience** - Clear loading states and disabled form  
✅ **Development friendly** - Keeps React StrictMode for debugging  
✅ **Easy to understand** - Simple flag-based protection  
✅ **Comprehensive logging** - Easy to debug future issues  

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Fill out the report form
2. Click "Submit report" 
3. Try clicking submit again quickly
4. Check console logs - you should see "Form submission already in progress" message
5. Check Cloudinary - only one copy of each image should be uploaded

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/routes/user-routes/ReportPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/utils/cloudinary.ts` 
- `mobile/utils/cloudinary.ts`

The mobile app already had similar protection in place.
